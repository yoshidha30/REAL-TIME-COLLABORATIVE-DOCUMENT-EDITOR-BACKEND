# TASK DESCRIPTION:

The backend of this project is built using Node.js with Express.js, forming a high-performance and scalable foundation. It handles core functionalities like document creation, retrieval, and live updates. Using Socket.IO, it establishes a persistent WebSocket connection between all connected clients, enabling real-time collaboration where changes are broadcast instantly across users.

To ensure reliable data storage, the project uses MongoDB, a NoSQL database that stores each document in a flexible and efficient format. Mongoose ORM is used for smooth interaction with MongoDB, handling schemas and data validations effortlessly.

Key highlights:

  ðŸ”¹WebSocket Integration using Socket.IO for instant, bidirectional communication.

  ðŸ”¹MongoDB Storage for dynamic document persistence and easy scalability.

  ðŸ”¹Express.js Routing for API endpoints and seamless frontend-backend communication.

  ðŸ”¹Robust architecture ensuring fast response time and real-time sync without page refreshes.

This backend acts as the brain of the systemâ€”managing document IDs, storing updates in intervals, and broadcasting changes in milliseconds, making the collaboration experience seamless and smooth.




# OUTPUT:

Backend Booted & Ready! 
Node.js server is live on port 3001, with MongoDB connected seamlessly. Real-time client connections are established, ensuring smooth and instant collaboration between users.
